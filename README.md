# Verilog Projects

This repository contains Verilog projects focused on digital circuit design and simulation. Each project includes source code and relevant documentation to facilitate understanding and replication.

## Projects

### 1. RGB Sequence Detector

**Description:**  
Design and implementation of a sequence detector that identifies a specific pattern within a stream of RGB inputs.

**Features:**
- Detects predefined RGB sequences.
- Outputs a signal upon successful detection.

**Files:**
- `rgb_sequence_detector.v`: Main Verilog module for the RGB sequence detector.
- `rgb_sequence_detector_tb.v`: Testbench for simulating and verifying the detector's functionality.

### 2. RISC-V ALU

**Description:**  
Implementation of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) compatible with the RISC-V instruction set architecture.

**Features:**
- Performs arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction.
- Executes logical operations like AND, OR, and XOR.
- Supports shift operations.

**Files:**
- `riscv_alu.v`: Verilog module defining the RISC-V ALU.
- `riscv_alu_tb.v`: Testbench for simulating and verifying the ALU's operations.
